# awk

AWK is built to process column-oriented text data, such as tables. In which a file is considered to consist of N records (rows) by M fields (columns)

### Basic

```bash
$ awk < file ‘{print $2}’
$ awk ‘{print $2}’ file
```

print $2 => 2nd field of the line, awk has whitespace as the default delimiter

### Delimiter

```bash
$ awk -F: ‘{print $2}’ file
```

-F: = use ‘:’ as delimiter

```bash
$ awk -F ‘[:;]’ ‘{print $2}’ file
```

-F ‘[:;]’ = use multiple delimiter, and parse using EITHER ‘:’ OR ‘;’

```bash
$ awk -F ‘:;’ ‘{print $2}’ file
```

-F ‘:;’ = use multiple delimiter, and parse using ':;’ as THE delimiter

```bash
$ awk -F ‘:’+ ‘{print $2}’ file
```

-F ‘:’+ = use multiple delimiter, to match any number ':'

### Arithmetic

```bash
$ echo 5 4 | awk '{print $1 + $2}'
```

Output is '9', the result of ‘+’ (works as addition)

```bash
$ echo 5 4 | awk '{print $1 $2}'
```

Output is '54', to get string concatenation

```bash
$ echo 5 4 | awk '{print $1, $2}'
```

Output is '5 4', to get value of 1st and 2nd field

### Variables

```bash
$ awk -F ‘<FS>’ ‘{print $2}’ file
```

FS, aka field separator variable, can consist of any single character or regular expression

e.g. awk -F ‘:’ ‘{print $3}’ /etc/passwd

```bash
$ awk -F ‘<FS>’ ‘BEGIN{OFS=“<OFS>”} {print $3, $4}’ file
```

OFS, aka output field separator variable, is the value inserted input separated output

e.g. awk -F ‘:’ ‘BEGIN{OFS=“|||”} {print $3, $4}’ /etc/passwd

```bash
$ awk ‘BEGIN {RS=‘<RS>’} {print $1}’ file
```

RS, aka row separator variable, it works the same as FS, but vertically

```bash
$ awk ‘BEGIN{ORS=“<OFS>”} {print $3, $4}’ file
```

ORS, aka output row separator variable, it works the similar way as OFS

```bash
$ awk ‘{print NR}’ file
```

NR, aka number of records, is equivalent to line number

It is quite helpful when calculating average

```bash
$ awk ‘{print NF}’ file
```

NF, aka number of fields, uses whitespace as delimiter and returns the field number the value will change when delimiter is redefined with ‘-F’

Note: awk ‘{print $NF}’ file

This will print out the last field of the line instead of number of fields, the similar usage is $0, which prints out the line

```bash
$ awk ‘{print FILENAME}’ file
```

It prints out the file name

```bash
$ awk ‘{print FILENAME, FNR}’ file1 file2
```

FNR, aka number of records for each input file, will give number of records depends on file specified
