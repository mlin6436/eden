# Reverse Mouse Scroll

Even though it is not as justifiable as it may seem, the only good reason to do this is I find it hard to cope scrolling mouse the 'wrong' way round as a Mac user.

```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zedtux/naturalscrolling
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install naturalscrolling
```

This is not the end, the application needs to be fired from Dash, and configured to the target device.
