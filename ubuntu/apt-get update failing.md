# apt-get update Failing

### apt-get update indexes not found error

This is part of the message I got when I did the normal `apt-get update`, and this stops me from being able to install ruby via rvm.

```

E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
```

The URLs specified don't exit anymore, which explains why I am getting this error. After some quick google, I try to `sudo apt-get update --fix-missing`, but that still doesn't  help. Then I stumble upon [this](http://blog.launchpad.net/ppa/failed-to-fetch-errors-for-ppas), and it has brighten up my day.

### Fix the missing indexes - by removing them

- Check sources list to comment out the missing indexes.

```bash
$ sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
```

- Also check the sources lists in this directory, because the `gophers-go-trusty.list` I have problem with actually lives inside this folder.

```bash
$ cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
```
